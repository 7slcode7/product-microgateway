      <title>WSO2 API Manager Microgateway Toolkit v2.5.0 - 4th July 2018</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <h1>WSO2 API Manager Microgateway Toolkit 2.5.0 Released!</h1>
   
      <p>
         The WSO2 API Manager team is pleased to announce the release of version 2.5.0 of
         the Open Source API Manager Microgateway Toolkit v2.5.0.
      </p>
   
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
         The Microgateway Toolkit provides the capability to create&nbsp;specialized gateway distribution (microgateway
         distributions) where only a single API&nbsp;or a group of APIs are included.&nbsp;Once a microgateway distribution
         is started, it will start serving those specific API(s) right away.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         In summary, a microgateway&nbsp;is a&nbsp;specialized form of the WSO2 API Gateway by having below main
         characteristics:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Its ability to execute in isolation without mandatory connections to other components
            (Key Manager, Traffic Manager, etc).
         </li>
         <li>Ability to host a subset of APIs of choice (defined on the API
            Publisher) instead of all.
         </li>
         <li>Immutability - if you update an API you need to re-create the
            container/instance, no hot deployment.<br>microgateway offers you a proxy that is capable of performing security
            validations (OAuth, Basic Auth, Signed JWT), in-memory (local) rate limiting and operational analytics.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
         Design Goals
      </h2>
      <p>
         Following are some of its main expectations of microgateway
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <ul>
         <li>Ability to host just one or a selected set (subset) of APIs only.&nbsp;<br></li>
         <li>Ability to execute in complete isolation once setup, without having the need to
            contact the Management or Security components.&nbsp;<br>
         </li>
         <li>Easy integration with CI/CD processes.&nbsp;<br></li>
         <li>Seamless integration with deployment automation tools and techniques</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
         Setting up Microgateway Toolkit
      </h2>
      <p>
         This product will include a CLI, the B7a platform distribution and a few B7a extensions (Endpoints and Filters). The
         Toolkit will have two main responsibilities.
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Setting up a microgateway project.</li>
         <li>Running the microgateway project.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         These two steps will be treated as two phases. One will first complete the "setup" phase and move on to the "build"
         phase. The reason for treating them as phases is to make it possible for developers to take control of the runtime
         if and when required. For example, what gets run as default on a microgateway is a simple API proxy. If a developer
         needs to perform some sort of an integration or change the source files for some other reason, he could
         engage with the project after the setup phase and do the required modifications before the distribution is
         built.
